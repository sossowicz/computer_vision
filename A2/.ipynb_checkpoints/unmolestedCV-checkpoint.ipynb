    "# Computer Vision 2023 Assignment 2: Image matching and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prac, you will experiment with image feature detectors, descriptors and matching. There are 3 main parts to the prac:\n",
    "\n",
    "- matching an object in a pair of images\n",
    "- searching for an object in a collection of images\n",
    "- analysis and discussion of results\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, you will use this notebook to run your code and display your results and analysis. Again we will mark a PDF conversion of your notebook, referring to your code if necessary, so you should ensure your code output is formatted neatly. \n",
    "\n",
    "***When converting to PDF, include the outputs and analysis only, not your code.*** You can do this from the command line using the `nbconvert` command (installed as part of Jupyter) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter nbconvert Assignment2.ipynb --to pdf --no-input --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags 'remove-cell'\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also remove the preamble text from each question. It has been packaged into a small notebook you can run in colab, called notebooktopdf.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `OpenCV` library to complete the prac. It has several built in functions that will be useful. You are expected to consult documentation and use them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the last assignment it is somewhat up to you how you answer each question. Ensure that the outputs and report are clear and easy to read so that the markers can rapidly assess what you have done, why, and how deep is your understanding. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sizing, arranging and captioning image outputs appropriately\n",
    "- explaining what you have done clearly and concisely\n",
    "- clearly separating answers to each question\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some example images for this assignment, available through a link on the MyUni assignment page. The images are organised by subject matter, with one folder containing images of book covers, one of museum exhibits, and another of urban landmarks. You should copy these data into a directory A2_smvs, keeping the directory structure the same as in the zip file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within each category (within each folder), there is a “Reference” folder containing a clean image of each object and a “Query” folder containing images taken on a mobile device. Within each category, images with the same name contain the same object (so 001.jpg in the Reference folder contains the same book as 001.jpg in the Query folder).\n",
    "The data is a subset of the Stanford Mobile Visual Search Dataset which is available at \n",
    "\n",
    "<http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/mmsys-dataset/2011/stanford/index.html>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The full data set contains more image categories and more query images of the objects we have provided, which may be useful for your testing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not submit your own copy of the data or rename any files or folders! For marking, we will assume the datasets are available in subfolders of the working directory using the same folder names provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some general setup code, which you can edit to suit your needs."

Download and read through the paper [ORB: an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111151_ORB_an_efficient_alternative_to_SIFT_or_SURF) by Rublee et al. You don't need to understand all the details, but try to get an idea of how it works. ORB combines the FAST corner detector (covered in week 3) and the BRIEF descriptor. BRIEF is based on similar ideas to the SIFT descriptor we covered week 3, but with some changes for efficiency.\n",

    "cv2.imread()\" to ensure that you read the gray scale image, since it is necessary for computing ORB features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Detect features] Create opencv ORB feature extractor by `orb=cv2.ORB_create()`. Then you can detect keypoints by `kp = orb.detect(img,None)`, and compute descriptors by `kp, des = orb.compute(img, kp)`. You need to do this for each image, and then you can use `cv2.drawKeypoints()` for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Match features] As ORB is a binary feature, you need to use HAMMING distance for matching, e.g., `bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING)`. Then you are requried to do KNN matching (k=2) by using `bf.knnMatch()`. After that, you are required to use \"ratio_test\" to find good matches. By default, you can set `ratio=0.8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [Plot and analyze] You need to visualize the matches by using the `cv2.drawMatches()` function. Also you can change the ratio values, parameters in `cv2.ORB_create()`, and distance functions in `cv2.BFMatcher()`. Please discuss how these changes influence the match numbers.\n"

    "<!--One application of feature matching is image retrieval. The goal of image retrieval is, given a query image of an object, to find all images in a database containing the same object, and return the results in ranked order (like a Google search). This is a huge research area but we will implement a very basic version of the problem based on the small dataset provided.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, the aim is to identify an \"unknown\" object depicted in a query image, by matching it to multiple reference images, and selecting the highest scoring match. Since we only have one reference image per object, there is at most one correct answer. This is useful for example if you want to automatically identify a book from a picture of its cover, or a painting or a geographic location from an unlabelled photograph of it.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Select a set of reference images and their corresponding query images. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Hint 1: Start with the book covers, or just a subset of them.\n",
    "    3. Hing 2: This question can require a lot of computation to run from start to finish, so cache intermediate results (e.g. feature descriptors) where you can.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Choose one query image corresponding to one of your reference images. Use RANSAC to match your query image to each reference image, and count the number of inlier matches found in each case. This will be the matching score for that image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify the query object. This is the identity of the reference image with the highest match score, or \"not in dataset\" if the maximum score is below a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2-3 for every query image and report the overall accuracy of your method (that is, the percentage of query images that were correctly matched in the dataset). Discussion of results should include both overall accuracy and individual failure cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Hint 1: In case of failure, what ranking did the actual match receive? If we used a \"top-k\" accuracy measure, where a match is considered correct if it appears in the top k match scores, would that change the result?\n",
